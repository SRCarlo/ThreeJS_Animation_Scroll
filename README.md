# Three.js Animation Scroll Website

## Overview

This project demonstrates a cutting-edge website design integrating **3D animations** with **scroll interaction** using **Three.js**, **WebGL**, and **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform). The website features a **3D animated model** (a demon bee) that moves and rotates smoothly as the user scrolls through the page, creating an immersive visual experience.

The project serves as an example of how modern web technologies can be used to enhance user engagement, storytelling, and interactivity on websites.

## Key Features

- **3D Interactive Animations**: The website uses **Three.js** to load and animate a 3D model (a demon bee). The animation is triggered and controlled based on the user's scroll position.
- **Smooth Scroll-Based Animation**: As the user scrolls through different sections of the website, the model's position and rotation are dynamically updated using **GSAP** for smooth transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to various screen sizes and devices to provide an optimal viewing experience.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: The project utilizes **WebGL** through **Three.js** for real-time 3D rendering.
- **Camera Control**: The project integrates **OrbitControls** for camera interaction, allowing users to interact with the 3D scene.
- **Lighting Effects**: Dynamic lighting using **AmbientLight** and **DirectionalLight** enhances the visual effects of the 3D model.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A library for advanced animations and smooth transitions.
- **WebGL**: Used for rendering 3D content directly in the browser.
- **GLTFLoader**: A loader for importing **.glb** (GLTF) 3D model files.
- **OrbitControls**: Allows user interaction with the 3D scene, such as rotating or zooming in/out.
- **HTML5 and CSS3**: For the basic structure and styling of the web pages.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing the logic and functionality.
